This Is An Example
==================

Please understand there is very little here, but it is handy to have somewhere to start when you don't know up from down.

Before you start, do the following:

1. Install node on your computer.
2. Install grunt-cli -- npm install grunt-cli -g
3. IN THIS DIRECTORY, install everything else -- npm install

To run the tests, just type: grunt test

Have fun!
